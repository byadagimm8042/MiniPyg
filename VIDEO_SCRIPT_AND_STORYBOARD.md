## 4. Suggested Workflow

1. **Generate assets** — Request each image from the list above (e.g. in Cursor or any image generator).
2. **Edit** — Import stills into Canva, CapCut, DaVinci Resolve, or After Effects; add simple transitions (fade/slide), hold each scene ~5–8 seconds.
3. **Voice** — Record the script (or use a TTS tool); align narration to the storyboard timings.
4. **Music** — Add a short, upbeat (non-lyric) track; keep it low under voice.
5. **Export** — 1080p, 30fps; optional 15–30s cut for social.

If you tell me which asset number(s) you want first, I can generate the image descriptions again or suggest exact prompts for your preferred tool.
